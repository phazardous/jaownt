/*QUAKED Darth_G_Notes (1 .6 0) (-19 -36 0) (19 36 70)
===========DESCRIPTION============================
Version: 1.0
From Darth G:

This is where you will find the description of all entities.

The spawnflags definitions (the best I could find or know).

The possible keys and their values (the best I could find or know). I have added either through research of released MP code or original description. I may have also found it helpful to add some things of my experience.

I have done research into the game engine to add things available normally to the Q3 game engine and added them as well.

I added models that have no value in the BSP process and are only for your visual assistance in mapping.

Where there is no model it is because there wasnt one md3 that fit well in JKA assets. (In other words the weapons are multiple parts that make one when used so no one md3 could be named to show to you in the mapping.)

I have removed duplicate or error entities. Because you cant simply remove from this list I either made an entity that you cant use (like this one) or I made the box that appears in the editor black so you can recognize that it is messed up some how or another.

If you find anything incorrect please contact me at either WWW.Map-Center.COM or at my site WWW.DarthG.COM .

Should you need to find the file again its name is MP_entities.def just do a search for it.

If you feel you need to alter the file it is yours to do as you wish just open it in WordPad or notepad. I simply ask that you leave this 'entity' for credit to the hours or work I put in here. If you would like me to add something to a next version just send the info to me and Ill work it in.

The model I used for this entity would be a good reference to scale your maps to normal player size too.

Available entities added:
_Decal

Mod Specific entities added:
trigger_scoreboard  (Hydroball)
trigger_playarea    (Hydroball)
trigger_goal        (Hydroball)
trigger_teamchoice  (Hydroball)
trigger_weaponstrip (Hydroball)
info_start_position (Hydroball)
info_ball_spawn     (Hydroball)

Hope this helps!

Happy mapping!
==============NOTES===============================
Special note to non experienced moders of this file. If you want to mod the order of entities in this list on the actual file you can not change the order and go back to a map that used a different order and deleting them really messes up the old maps BAD!!

This creates nothing in your map and will be completely disregarded in the BSP process.

==============NOTES===============================
The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the 'wait' value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's 'wait' key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, it's value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

This can point at a target_give entity for respawn freebies.

This represents a spawn point for team2 on the map. You can target these points in order to enable/disable them. This allows you to trigger new sets of spawn points upon different events occuring on the map. There is also a "startoff" key, if you set it non-0 the spawn point will be disabled at the start until activated. idealclass key will specify the ideal class to spawn on this point, and the value should correspond to the name field in a .scl file. Classes will first check for points that match their ideal class when spawning, and if they cannot find any, they will fall back to normal team spawn points.

===========DESCRIPTION============================ 
Arbitrary .md3 or .ase model to add to map and turns into map triangles and is stored in .bsp file. (See misc_model_static new entity improved .bsp storage.) 
===========SPAWNFLAGS============================= 
SOLID - Sets the auto clipping spawnflag, automatically assigning q3map_clipmodel to any shaders used by the model. Use of Q3Map2 auto clipping for models is only recommended for large models with relatively few triangles in their mesh (i.e. terrain). The Q3Map2 auto clipping algorithm is a bit of a hack, and can hurt in-game performance (as well as produce erroneous clipping results) when used on small, dense models. 

LIGHTED - Sets the forcemeta spawnflag, automatically adding q3map_forcemeta to any shaders used by the model (which, in turn, allows the model to become lightmapped). This, effectively, is the 'lightmapped model' spawnflag. 
===========KEYS&VALUES============================ 
'angle' (1 - 359) Rotates model on Z axis. 

'angles' 0 0 0 (X Y Z) This is different than angle. This allow you to rotate a model on all axi. 

'model'      arbitrary .md3 or .ase file to display 

'modelscale' Scale on all axis 1 is default. 2 is double size. .5 is half size 

'modelscale_vec' Scale difference axis. (1 1 1) default (X Y Z) 

'_rs' (or _receiveshadows) - Allows per-entity control over shadow reception. Defaults to 1 on everything. 0 = receives no shadows, 1 = receives world shadows. Can be used in conjunction with _cs (or _castshadows) for tighter control of where, exactly, certain shadows fall. A _rs value greater than 1 (say, '7') would receive world shadows, as well as shadows from any entity with a corresponding _cs value ('7' again). A _rs value less than 1 (say, '-7') would receive shadows only from entities with a corresponding _cs value ('-7') and not receive world shadows. _rs is used on any entity. 

'_cs' (or _castshadows) Allows per-entity control over shadow casting. Defaults to 0 on entities, 1 on world. 0 = no shadow casting, 1 = casts shadows on world. Can be used in conjunction with _rs (or _receiveshadows) for tighter control of where, exactly, certain shadows fall. A _cs value greater than 1 (say, '7') would cast shadows on the world, and on any entity with a corresponding _rs value ('7' again, in our case) as well. A _cs value less than 1 (say, '-7') would cast shadows only on entities with a corresponding _rs value ('-7') and not cast shadows on the world. _cs is used on any entity. misc_model entities, which are static, belongs to world. 

'_remap' - Remap the shader of a model (*See notes.) 
==============NOTES=============================== 
You can change the shaders of models. 
To replace all model shaders use these keys:

The second method can be handy for replacing the crystal rift shaders so you can have red ones too. because you are only changing the crystal the other parts of the models remain the same.... handy for ctf maps ;) notice in the first example * means all model shaders make sure you seperate shaders with ; Changes you make to your models can be seen in realtime in gtk radiant, so if the skin doesnt change you havent specified a correct shader to replace.

Radius is automatically calculated in-world.

Waypoint: Are used to set the main routes of navigation. They should be placed at intersections and in rooms. Any place where the player or an NPC can reach should be in view of a waypoint (with some certain exceptions, see below). Each one should be placed on the ground and with a direct clear path ("clear path" means a full player-size "trace") to at least one other waypoint. You may, however, place a waypoint by itself, if that is desirable. You connect waypoints to each other using the fields "target", "target2", "target3", and "target4" (Radiant auto-manages these well and draws each of these connections). Waypoints are also auto-linked by the game at load time. These automatically generated connections are in addition to your manual connections. Although waypoints don't need to be manually connected, connections you might expect the game to generate may not occur and connections you did not anticipate may occur. So it is recommended that waypoints be manually connected to reflect a desired navigation flow. The basic rule is link where you definitely want a connection. Also bear in mind that all of your manual connections will be verified (a trace will be done to assure that there is a full body-size clear trace between two connected waypoints). If a manual (or "hard") connection fails this test, a warning is issued and the connection will not be used.

===========SPAWNFLAGS=============================
SOLID_OK - only use if placing inside solid is unavoidable in map, but may be clear in-game (i.e.: at the bottom of a tall, solid lift that starts at the top position).
===========KEYS&VALUES============================
'targetname' - Name you would use in script when setting a navgoal. (See notes.)

'radius' - How far from the navgoal an entity can be before it thinks it reached it. Default is '0' which means no radius check, just have to touch it.
==============NOTES===============================
For example: if you give this waypoint a targetname of 'console', make an NPC go to it in a script like so:

set ('navgoal', 'console');

Navigation Goals should be off the main waypoint network.
They must have a clear path to at least one waypoint. These are specific destinations off of the main path and are used exclusively for scripting (with the SET_NAVGOAL command). Basically an NPC will try to follow the waypoint network to reach this goal. You don't need waypoints exactly near a navgoal as long as there is a clear path between a navgoal and any waypoint. A navgoal's radius may be used to decide when an NPC has reached the navgoal (so if the origin of an NPC, their center, is within the radius of the navgoal, it will think it has reached it). Default radius is 12. A normal character's bounding box width is 32x32. So, obviously, you do not want to place a navgoal closer than 16 to a wall. Placing it right up against the wall (so that its side is coplanar with the wall) is too close. Always leave at least 1 unit between a navgoal's box and a wall. NOTE: there are no more variations of navgoals (such as "waypoint_navgoal_2", etc), only "waypoint_navgoal".

A navgoal's radius may be used to decide when an NPC has reached the navgoal (so if the origin of an NPC, their center, is within the radius of the navgoal, it will think it has reached it). Default radius is 12. A normal character's bounding box width is 32x32. So, obviously, you do not want to place a navgoal closer than 16 to a wall. Placing it right up against the wall (so that its side is coplanar with the wall) is too close. Always leave at least 1 unit between a navgoal's box and a wall.

/*QUAKED Darth_G_Tips (1 .6 0) (-8 -8 -16) (8 8 16)
===========DESCRIPTION============================
Version: 1.0
From Darth G:

How to connect entities:
Two ways to connect entities. One is automatic and the other is manual.

Automatic: You first deselect all entities (press ESC twice) then select the triggering entity. Then select the target entity and press ctrl + K. This will cause the connection.

Manual: You first deselect all entities and then select the trigger entity and open the entity window (N) and add key:target and value:(unique name you want). Now deselect the trigger entity and select the target entity. Open the entity window and add key:targetname and value:(the same unique name you used in the target) remember that the names can not have spaces.

How to prevent leaks:
Two things I will share here is; 1 Most entity leaks are caused by using the space bar to reproduce an entity as a short cut. This is what causes the leaks. Just make them from scratch.

How and when to save:
Save as often as you would for anything you wouldn't want to lose but my tip is to save after any major changes with another name. Sometimes the saved file can be saved corrupted.

How to save FPS and texture work:
There is a lot that can be done to save FPS but the one tip I will share here is to work your initial brush work in caulk.


Hope this helps!

Happy mapping!

Compiler-only entity that specifies a decal to be projected. The distance between the center of the _decal entity and the target is the axis and distance of projection. Should contain one or more patch meshes and target an info_null entity. The targeting line drawn between the center of the _decal entity and the targeted info_null is the axis and distance of projection. It helps to think of the _decal mesh as if it were a light gel, the info_null were the target of a spotlight, and that you were 'shining' this decal onto map geometry.

Note to user: the surface of the info_null that would first be hit should be the closest to the surface to prject on. In other words put the info_null in the wall or geometry.
